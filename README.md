Software Development Lifecycle Course

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User stories are the backbone of any agile development project, they illustrate the product vision through a series of "stories" that outline the user's needs and their acceptance criteria.  Testers can then test inputs and expected outputs to see if they line up.


How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I'd like to try out the concept of planning lightly and coming up with a working product that I can then test and do a series of evolving releases, as opposed to heavy upfront planning that can break down and cause problems.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
It appears that communication and patience are key, as with most teams, but in software development there seem to be many pitfalls and challenges that can be very difficult to overcome. Dealing with the uncertainty and probably being willing to let go of work that was done that doesn't serve a purpose anymore and was only part of the process.
